##Visualizing data using ggplot2
ggplot2 is a declarative plotting library. The gg in ggplot2 stands for "Grammar of Graphics" a book on the principles of data visualization that the package is based on. According to this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-grammar-of-graphics-for-effective-visualization-of-multi-dimensional-1f92b4ed4149):

>grammar of graphics is a framework which follows a layered approach to describe and construct visualizations or graphics in a structured manner. A visualization involving multi-dimensional data often has multiple components or aspects, and leveraging this layered grammar of graphics helps us describe and understand each component involved in visualization‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin terms of data, aesthetics, scale, objects and so on.

You can think about the layering of graphics in the same way as the principle of composition that you learnt last week i.e. building complex functionality by breaking things down into smaller pieces. In the context of data manipulation using `dplyr` we used ` %>%`, here we use graphical layers.

There are seven layers in ggplot. All plots need a minimum of three out of these seven layers (the rest adopt default values if not specified). These are as follows:

1. A data layer
2. An aesthetics layer
3. A geom or statistics layer

Lets start plotting!

###Basic charts
In this section we will explore a few basic chart types. Lets also open the [reference website for ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) in a new tab so that we have it handy. We will be using the gapminder dataset to illustrate ggplot commands. This dataset is available as a package of the same name [^1]. Go ahead and install this on your computer. The gapminder dataset is displayed below. It provides data on life expectancy (<span class="variable">lifeExp</span>), population (<span class="variable">pop</span>) and GDP per capita (<span class="variable">gdpPercap</span>) for each country for five year intervals from `r min(gapminder$year)` to `r max(gapminder$year)`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
##load the packages
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13); library(gapminder)
gapminder
```

###Scatterplot
The first plot we will explore is the scatter-plot. A scatter-plot simply places a point on a cartesian (2-D) coordinate system for corresponding values of the x and y variables. Lets explore the relationship between year and life expectancy using a scatter-plot. 

Go through the code below to identify the data, aesthetics and geom layers. As can be seen below, this is not a particularly useful chart. Each year in the data has several observations for <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> (one for each country), this results in a chart for which it is difficult to perceive a clear trend. In the next step we will see how to improve this chart.

```{r}
##specify the data and aesthetics layer
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    ##specifying the geom type
    geom_point() +
    ##adding x and y axis titles
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy")
```

‚ö°***Ninja Tasks***‚ö°

1. Use a scatter-plot to explore the relationship between <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> and <span class="variable">lifeExp</span>

<div class="solution">
üèÜ***Solution***üèÜ: The gapminder data consists of observations for each country for each year. We are interested in capturing the relationship between <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> and the <span class="variable">lifeExp</span>. However, since the data is a time series, we need to average the <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> and <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> for each country for the entire time series before plotting to smooth out time trends and avoid over-plotting [^2]. This would allow us to observe the relationship between the two variables more clearly without any confusing time trends [^3].

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    ##find the mean gdp per capita and life expectancy for each country
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarise(meanGDPperCap = mean(gdpPercap, na.rm = T), 
              meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ##specify the data and aesthetics layer
    ggplot(., aes(x = meanGDPperCap, y = meanLifeExp)) + 
    ##specify the geom
    geom_point(colour = "blue", size = 2.5, alpha = 0.8) +
    ##specify titles
    labs(x = "Mean GDP per capita", 
         y = "Mean Life Expectancy", 
         title = "Life Expectancy increases with GDP per capita")
```

The scatter-plot shows one single point for each country in the dataset representing the mean <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> and <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span>. Make sure to read the code used to generate the chart carefully so that you understand it fully. Why are the colour and size paramters in the `geom_point()` not inside an `aes()`?

</div>

2. Bonus question: Can you map the <span class="variable">pop</span> to a particular aesthetic so that it can be displayed on the chart too?

<div class="solution">
üèÜ***Solution***üèÜ:  Lets map the size of each point to the average population. I also introduce an additional aesthetic mapping of colour to the continent variable. In addition, since there are large values in the <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span>, we can plot the log of the mean <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> to smooth out the large numbers (<span class="highlight">[watch](#logs)</span> the video below if you don't fully understand logarithmic scales). 

We can do this in two ways, first we could mutate <span class="variable">meanGDPperCap</span> by taking its log and plotting that (try this yourself)[^4], and the second option would be to use ggplots inbuilt `scale_x_log10()` command to transform the plotting scale instead of the variable. While the charts would largely look the same, the second option preserves the actual variable and plots it on the new scale. Plot the first option on your own to see if you can spot the difference between the plot below and that one.

The application of the log scale has the effect of making it appear as if the relationship between <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> and <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> is linear. <span class="highlight">This is not true</span>, since as we observed in the previous chart the true relationship between these two variables is parabolic i.e. as <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> increases, the corresponding increase in <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> gets lower over time (probably because we can't extend human lifespans beyond a certain limit, no matter how hard we try). This is one reason, why we should be extremely careful with scale transformations. We should only use them if we have a clear reason for why they are necessary. And when we do choose to use them we should have a clear sense for what they are doing to the interpretation of the chart.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    ##Calculate country level information
    group_by(country) %>% 
    summarise(meanGDPperCap = mean(gdpPercap, na.rm = T), 
              meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T), 
              meanPop = mean(pop, na.rm = T),
              continent = unique(continent)) %>% 
    ##specify data and aesthetics
    ggplot(., aes(x = meanGDPperCap, 
                  y = meanLifeExp, 
                  size = meanPop, 
                  colour = continent)) + 
    ##specify the geom
    geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
    ##apply scale transformation
    scale_x_log10() +
    ##specify the titles
    labs(x = "Mean GDP per capita", 
         y = "Mean Life Expectancy", 
         title = "Life Expectancy increases exth GDP per capita", 
         size = "Mean population",
         colour = "Continent") +
    ##adjust the position and layout of the legends
    theme(legend.position = "top",
          legend.box = "vertical",
          legend.spacing.y = unit(-8, "pt"),
          )
```

### Line chart
Now lets use dplyr to calculate the average global <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> by year and plot that using a line. As can be seen below, the average global <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> has been increasing over the years.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    ##group by year to calculate the yearly average life expectancy for the world (all countries)
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarise(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ##draw a line marking the trend of life expectancy over years
    ggplot(., aes(x = year, y = meanLifeExp)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "Average life expectancy has been increasing", x = "Years", y = "Mean Life Expectancy")
```

Now lets go a bit further and explore the trend for <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> for different countries. No
```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
    ##colour and group are mapped to continent and country and aesthetic is set to 0.5
    geom_line(mapping = aes(colour = continent, group = country), alpha = 0.5) +
    labs(title = "Countries in Africa have lower life expectancy", x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy") +
    theme(
        legend.position = "top"
        
    )
```

In the chart above there are a few countries that experience sudden drops in <span class="variable">lifeExp</span>. These are because of genocides that occurred in Rwanda, Cambodia and China. The chart below used color and alpha mapping to highlight these values. Notice how, I use a alphaMapping and colorMapping variables to fix the alpha and colour aesthetics in the chart.[^6]
```{r}
##repeat the same but with one line for each continent/country, (guess why there is a sudden drop for a few countries)?
alphaMapping <- if_else(gapminder$country %in% c("Rwanda", "Cambodia", "China"), 0.8, 0.1)
colorMapping <- if_else(gapminder$country %in% c("Rwanda", "Cambodia", "China"), "darkred", "black")

ggplot(data = gapminder, mapping = aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, group = country)) +
    geom_line(alpha = alphaMapping, colour = colorMapping) +
    labs(title = "The impact of genocides on life expectancy", x = "Year", y = "Life Expectancy")
```


‚ö°***Ninja Tasks***‚ö°

1. Draw a line chart showing the trend for average <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> through time for each continent

<div class="solution">
üèÜ***Solution***üèÜ: The chart below shows that poorer countries in the Africa and Asia are still lagging behind those in the West. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(economics)) convergence can be described as follows:

>The idea of convergence in economics (also sometimes known as the catch-up effect) is the hypothesis that poorer economies' per capita incomes will tend to grow at faster rates than richer economies. As a result, all economies should eventually converge in terms of per capita income.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(continent, year) %>% 
    summarise(meanGDP = mean(gdpPercap, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ggplot(., aes(x = year, y = meanGDP)) +
    geom_line(aes(colour = continent)) +
    labs(x = "Year", y = "Mean GDP per Capita", title = "Convergence where art thou?", colour = "Continent") +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
```

</div>

3. Histogram
Watch the video [below](#hist) to refresh your understanding of histograms. The plot below shows the histogram of `gdpPerCap` in the gapminder dataset. There is however a problem with this chart. It shows the distribution of <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> over time. We are however not interested in the spread of <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> across time, rather our interest is in seeing the spread across countries. In this case, we might be better off by filtering down to a single year and observing the distribution of <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> across countries. Lets try this out with the training exercise.
```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(gdpPercap)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```
<div class="center-container">
<a id="hist"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSEYtAjuZ-Y" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></a>
</div>

‚ö°***Ninja Tasks***‚ö°

1. Draw a histogram to show the characteristics of population

<div class="solution">
üèÜ***Solution***üèÜ: For this chart we select the latest year in the dataset and plot the distribution of the population. Could you think of the pros and cons for using this method versus the one in which we calculate the average population for each country over the entire dataset and plotting that?

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year == max(year, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ggplot(., aes(pop)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 60) +
    labs(x = "Population", y = "Count")
```

</div>

###Bar chart
The chart below shows the average <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> for different continents for the most recent year in the data. Can you think of the reason why it might be slightly better to have only considered the most recent year when calculating the average <span class="variable">lifeExp</span> for a continent? Also notice, how the bars are aligned from the smallest to the tallest. Can you find out how I might have achieved this?
```{r}
##draw a bar chart with average life expectancy in different continents
gapminder %>% 
    filter(year == max(year, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    group_by(continent) %>% 
    summarise(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ggplot(., aes(x = reorder(continent, meanLifeExp), y = meanLifeExp)) +
    geom_col() +
    labs(y = "Mean life expectancy") +
    theme(
        axis.title.x = element_blank()
    )
    
```

    geom_col()
    
```


```{r}
gapminder %>%

```

###Facetting

    filter(meanPop < 5e7) %>%

##Data Joins
A data join combines two or more different data tables into one. Tables that can be connected to each other can be thought of as being "related". A group of two or more related data tables would constitute a <span class="highlight">relational database</span>. The variables that connect two or more tables with each other are called <span class="highlight">keys</span>. For instance, consider two tables, one with information on GDP of countries and another with the population of countries. These two tables are related to one another through the shared key of country. If we were to manually calculate <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> of a specific country we would look for the corresponding values for the country in each table to extract the respective values of GDP and population to calculate <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> (GDP/population).

We will be using the practice datasets `band_members` and `band_instruments` provided in the `dplyr` package to understand the various concepts in data joins. I have added an additional row to the `band_instruments` table to make it easier to illustrate a few concepts. Please take a moment to look at the two data tables.

```{r}
##display band_members
band_members
```

```{r}
##remove band_members from the local environment
rm(band_instruments)

##add a row to band_instruments (give John an extra instrument)
band_instruments <- bind_rows(band_instruments, tibble(name = "John", plays = "keyboards"))

##display band_instruments
band_instruments
```

Keys can be of two types - primary and foreign. A key that uniquely identifies each row in a particular dataset is its primary key. For instance in the tibble `band_members` the primary key is the variable <span class="variable">name</span> since each row can be uniquely identified if we know the value of <span class="variable">name</span>. We can check if a variable is a primary key by grouping the data and checking the number of rows in each group. If there are more than one row in a group it means that the particularly grouping variable does not uniquely identify each row in the data i.e. there are multiple rows that have the same value for that grouping variable, hence it is not a primary key. 
```{r}
##proof that name is a primary key for band_members
band_members %>% 
    group_by(name) %>% 
    filter(n() > 1)
```

A primary key can also be a combination of two or more variables. For instance, in the case of band_instruments, <span class="variable">name</span> alone does not uniquely identify each row in the data (since we added an additional row for John). However, we can combine the variables name and play to uniquely identify every row in the data

There are 6 different types of joins. Four of these are called <span class="highlight">mutating joins</span> and two are called <span class="highlight">filtering</span>. A mutating join between two tables "x" and "y" creates a new table with columns from both x and y. A filtering join between x and y creates a new table with a subset of the rows from x and y. A mutating join can also lead to a subsetting of rows. Now lets look at each join in detail 




The output below shows an inner join. Here we have used the common key variable "name" to perform an inner join of the band_members and band_instruments. The inner join  and all the columns from x and yonly keeps the rows that have common keys</span> between x and y. The graphic below illustrates an `inner_join()`
```{r}
inner_join(x = band_members, y = band_instruments, by = "name")
```

<div class="center-container">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("assets/images/join-inner.png")
```
</div>
<small>**Source**: R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham</small>

`left_join()` is the most commonly used join. It preserves all the rows in x and 
```{r}
left_join(x = band_members, y = band_instruments, by = "name")
```


```{r}
right_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```

```{r}
full_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```



```{r}
semi_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```


```{r}
anti_join(band_members, band_instruments)
```


###Left Join
This is the most popular type of join (analogous to Vlookup in Excel).
```{r}
library(nycflights13)

flightsWithWeather <- left_join(flights, weather, by = c("origin", "month", "day", "hour"))
```


```{r}
weather
```




[^1]: The gapminder package is an excerpt of the data that exists [here](https://www.gapminder.org/data/). This data was created by the Gapminder Foundation led by Hans Rosling.
[^2]: Over-plotting happens when data points are plotted on top of each other multiple times. It makes charts more confusing and difficult to read. It should be avoided as far as possible
[^3]: We could also do this by filtering out the most recent year to study the relationship. Both are valid options, however the former has the benefit of capturing more information since it takes into account the entire time series of data that is available to calculate the mean values, while the latter disregards all but one year of the data. In this case this suits our purposes of wanting to study the relationship between <span class="variable">gdpPercap</span> and <span class="variable">lifeExp</span>.
[^4]: You can do this using the following command `ggplot(., aes(x = log(meanGDPperCap, base = 10), y = meanLifeExp))` instead of `ggplot(., aes(x = meanGDPperCap, y = meanLifeExp))`. Can you tell the difference between this plot and the one that was made using the scale transformation?
[^5]: This5 aesthetic parameters are not being mapped to the data. Instead we are using vectors that were created outside the current function call to specify the values for these vectors.
