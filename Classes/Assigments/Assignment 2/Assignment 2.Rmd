**Instructions**:
<div class="emphasize">
Please read the following instructions carefully. I want to understand why flights get delayed. Here are a few hypotheses that I would like you to explore. Some of these might be true while others might not be.

1. Departure delays are more common for long distance flights
2. Some airports have more departure delays than others
3. Some flight carriers have more departure delays than others
4. Flights to certain destinations have more delays than others.
5. Bad weather causes departure delays
6. Busy days (days with more flights) have more departure delays.
7. Some months have more delay than others (seasonal trends)
8. Flights during certain times of the day are more delayed

Concepts that you would need to apply to fully answer all the questions are as follows: 

* data manipulation using dplyr
* visualizations using ggplot2
* data joins
</div>

**How to answer:** Create a separate h2 level heading for each hypotheses and use the concepts that you have learnt so far to explore it. Each h2 section at minimum must have a chart or a table, and text explaining your reasons for accepting or rejecting each of these hypotheses. The final notebook should be nicely formatted and look professional.

**How to submit:** The output should be saved as a notebook (.nb.html file) and shared **privately** with me on Slack. The name of the assignment should be "<your first name>_assignment_2".
