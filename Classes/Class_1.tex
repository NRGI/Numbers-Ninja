\subsection{Pre-requisites}\label{pre-requisites}

There two things we need to do before we start the lesson.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{Install R}: Any of the links on
  that page should work
\item
  \href{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{Install
  Rstudio}: Choose the option that is suited for your Operating System
  (OS).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Get familiar with your working
environment}\label{get-familiar-with-your-working-environment}

When you installed R on your computer, you provide it the tools
necessary to process code that is written in R. The Base R installation
ships with a simple code editor that can be used to write R scripts.
RStudio is a software application that builds on top of your R
installation to give you additional functionality to write and manage R
code and projects \footnote{The techinical term for this type of
  software application is:
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment}{integrated
  development environment}(IDE).}. It is by far the most popular
integrated development environment (IDE) for R and has several features
that are custom made to support data science in R.

There are four different panes on RStudio that you need to get familiar
with.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The console: This is the pane that is usually located on the left (at
  the bottom if you have a script or notebook open) that can be used to
  type in R commands. The console is a great place to test out lines of
  code that doesn't necessarily have to go into the project you are
  woring on. The console is also the place were the output of your code
  are printed \footnote{This is true for all formats other than those
    that use R Markdown. In the case script formats that use R markdown
    the output is printed within the script rather than in the console.}.
  The console however, is not the place to write any code that you need
  to rerun since it is not possible to save code that is written in the
  console as a file. You will need to use the code pane to do that.
\item
  The code: This is were you will write the majority of the code for
  your projects. There are several different formats in which you can
  write code. This pane only appears if you have an open file that you
  are currently working on. Click on the
  \includegraphics{assets/scripts.png} button at the top left of R
  Studio to see the different options. We will use the first two options
  R Notebook and R Script for most of this course.
\item
  The viewer: The pane to the bottom right is where you can view plots
  rendered by your code, packages that are currently loaded to the
  environment, access help files, view documents, and access folders on
  your computer. Click on the \includegraphics{assets/packages.png} tab
  to scroll through the list and see all the packages that are checked.
  These are the packages that are pre-loaded with your session. If you
  don't know what packages are, don't worry, we will be covering that
  very soon.
\item
  The environment: The environment pane is the one on the top-right.
  This is were all the variables and functions that you create are
  displayed. R Studio provides additional functionality that allows
  users to click on these variables to view their contents. Click on
  \includegraphics{assets/global environ.png} dropdown you will notice
  that there are several other packages that are listed there. These are
  the same as those that are checked in the packages tab on the viewer
  pane. Selecting one of them will display the entire list of functions
  that are currently available for you to use.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{A quick R Markdown detour}\label{a-quick-r-markdown-detour}

Markdown is a markup language.

\begin{quote}
In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for
annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable
from the text\ldots{}the whole idea of a mark up language is to avoid
the formatting work for the text, as the tags in the mark up language
serve the purpose to format the appropriate text (like a header or
beginning of a next para\ldots{}etc.). Every tag used in a Markup
language has a property to format the text we write. - Wikipedia
\end{quote}

{Hyper Text Markup
Language}(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML}{HTML}) is perhaps
the most well-known markup language out there \footnote{Some other
  examples include - \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX}{TeX} and
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX}{LaTeX}. TeX is the markup
  language that used as a
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting}{typesetting system}
  in computers for high quality books. LaTeX is used extensively in
  academia to create documents.}. It is used to render content on
websites. Go ahead and right click on any webpage and click on inspect
to open up the web inspector to view the underlying HTML code that was
used to generate it. {Markdown} is a more human friendly (but limited)
version of HTML. Markdown uses simple and easy to read tags to markup
text which is compiled (by your computer) into HTML that can be used to
render webpages. Making it easier to create content that can be rendered
on a webpage for those who are unfamiliar with HTML.

{R Markdown} is a package in that allows us to combine markdown with R
code. Using R Markdown we can create a wide variety of easy to read and
reproduce R documents that contain both code and nicely formatted. This
online R notebook is a case in point.

In addition to using markdown to markup text, R Markdown documents also
uses {R Markdown}\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML}{YAML}. This
is the section right at the top of the notebook that is separated by the
\texttt{-\/-\/-}. This is the part of the document were you specify the
title and other characteristics of the report.

\subsection{Packages}\label{packages}

Packages that make our job as coders easier by extending the
functionality of base R. Each package contains a collection of functions
that we can use in our code without having to worry about needing to
write and maintain them ourselves. In addition to functions, packages
can also contain data or point database api (such \texttt{wbstats} which
points to the World Banks data). R has an extremely rich, well
maintained ecosystem of packages that contain functions and data that
are relevant to almost any academic (or even trivial) topics of
interest.

\paragraph{Tibbles}\label{tibbles}

⚡\textbf{\emph{Ninja Tasks}}⚡

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Create a tibble (of your choice) with three observations and three
  variables.
\item
  Show the class and structure of the tibble you created.
\item
  Convert the mtcars data set to a tibble.
\end{enumerate}

🏆\textbf{\emph{Solution}}🏆

Lets create a tibble using the \texttt{tibble()} command. Check out the
code below. Each input in the tibble command is a column. Notice how I
have used both column vectors created within \texttt{tibble()} and an
externally created the vector \texttt{hobby} inside the command.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{hobbies <-}\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dancing"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"hiking"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"reading"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{myFavoriteThings <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{tibble}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{gadgets =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Pixel"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Kindle"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Vaccum Cleaner"}\NormalTok{), }\DataTypeTok{books =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"Das Kapital"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Harry Potter"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Enid Blyton"}\NormalTok{), hobbies, }\DataTypeTok{milesRun =} \KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{))}

\NormalTok{myFavoriteThings}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 3 x 4
##   gadgets        books        hobbies milesRun
##   <chr>          <chr>        <chr>      <dbl>
## 1 Pixel          Das Kapital  dancing        1
## 2 Kindle         Harry Potter hiking         3
## 3 Vaccum Cleaner Enid Blyton  reading       10
\end{verbatim}

Lets checkout the structure using the \texttt{str()} command.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{str}\NormalTok{(myFavoriteThings)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    3 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ gadgets : chr  "Pixel" "Kindle" "Vaccum Cleaner"
##  $ books   : chr  "Das Kapital" "Harry Potter" "Enid Blyton"
##  $ hobbies : chr  "dancing" "hiking" "reading"
##  $ milesRun: num  1 3 10
\end{verbatim}

The tidyverse also provides a function called \texttt{glimpse()} to do
the same thing as \texttt{str()}. Notice the differences between the
outputs from the two commands.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{glimpse}\NormalTok{(myFavoriteThings)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Observations: 3
## Variables: 4
## $ gadgets  <chr> "Pixel", "Kindle", "Vaccum Cleaner"
## $ books    <chr> "Das Kapital", "Harry Potter", "Enid Blyton"
## $ hobbies  <chr> "dancing", "hiking", "reading"
## $ milesRun <dbl> 1, 3, 10
\end{verbatim}

You can access the class of any object in R using the \texttt{class()}
command. Notice how there are three classes for a tibble - ``tbl\_df'',
``df'' and ``data.frame''. Tibbles really are just data.frames with some
added functionality on top that is provided by the df and tbl\_df
classes.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{class}\NormalTok{(myFavoriteThings)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
\end{verbatim}

\texttt{mtcars} is a part of the \texttt{datasets} package that is
preloaded in R. Lets first look at its structure using \texttt{str()}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{str}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 'data.frame':    32 obs. of  11 variables:
##  $ mpg : num  21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ...
##  $ cyl : num  6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ...
##  $ disp: num  160 160 108 258 360 ...
##  $ hp  : num  110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ...
##  $ drat: num  3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ...
##  $ wt  : num  2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ...
##  $ qsec: num  16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ...
##  $ vs  : num  0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ...
##  $ am  : num  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
##  $ gear: num  4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ...
##  $ carb: num  4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ...
\end{verbatim}

As you can see the class of mtcars is a data.frame and not a tibble. We
can convert it to a tibble using the \texttt{as\_tibble()} command.
Below, I have used this command to create a new tibble called
\texttt{mtTibble}. The output shows it structure. Notice that now we
have the two additional classes ``df'' and ``tbl\_df'' that characterize
tibbles.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mtTibble <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{as_tibble}\NormalTok{(mtcars)}

\KeywordTok{str}\NormalTok{(mtTibble)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
