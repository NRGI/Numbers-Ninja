##Pre-requisites

There two things we need to do before we start the lesson.

1. [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html): Any of the links on that page should work
2. [Install Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/): Choose the option that is suited for your Operating System (OS).

##Get familiar with your working environment

RStudio is an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)(IDE) for the programming language R. An IDE is a software application that makes it easier to write and manage code. It is by far the most popular IDE for R and has several features that are custom made to support data science in R.

There are four different panes on RStudio: The console, scripts, environment and viewer. You can reposition these using the Pane Layout tab on preferences.
